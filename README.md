# Description

This app served as an experiment for me to try Flutter for the first time.
This is a "fake" banking app with frontend only. (No web API calls)

## Instructions

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
